1. Cairis
==============
Cairis is an open-source threat modeling tool released in 2012. It is one of the most comprehensive open-source tools available.
Platform: Cairns is a web-based tool.
Core features: Once the necessary system information is imported, the tool pretty much takes over. It lets you create attacker personas. Personas are details of potential attackers — their goals, their resources, and possible path of attack. It offers 12 different views of your system —for example, it offers one view from a risk perspective while another from the architectural perspective. Cairis APIs make it easy to integrate with existing workflows. It spots attack patterns and lets you rationalize each mitigation tactic using a Data Flow Diagram.
Unique features: You can define ‘environments’ or contexts that each asset operates in. This can be physical, social, or temporal. For example, certain plant operations that might take longer in the day.
Usability: All current Cairis users report good usability. While there are reports of system information input being time-consuming, the rest of the software is considered easy flowing. 
Customer support: Cairis has very detailed documentation online, along with various demos and video tutorials.
Pricing model: Cairis is open-source, so there is no applicable pricing model.
Editorial comments: Organizations that can potentially gain the most from Cairis are those with existing security skills and are looking into open source options.
